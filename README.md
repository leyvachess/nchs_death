# NCHS Mortality Visualization App

**Introduction**
The NCHS Mortality Visualization [App](https://anthonyleyva.shinyapps.io/nchs_death/) examines a series of death statistics from 1900-2017. The first plot shows the average death rates by year for US adults. The second plot shows each year's average life expectancy, which can be filtered by race and/or sex.

**Instructions**
For plot 1, check and uncheck the boxes to view how each cause of death impacted US adults. You may check multiple boxes at a time; if you uncheck all the boxes, it will display all of the causes of death (as if all of the boxes were checked, instead of none).

For plot 2, please note that "Both Sexes" and "All Races" provides the data without any filters. In total, there are nine different data combinations for sex and race.
